      HANGMAN RULES
=============================

1. The computer chooses a secret word.
2. You guess one letter at a time.
3. If the letter is in the word, it is revealed.
4. If the letter is not in the word, you lose a life.
5. You have 6 lives in total.
6. Guess all the letters before your lives reach 0.


Good luck!
